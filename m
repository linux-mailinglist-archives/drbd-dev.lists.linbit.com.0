Right.  AFAICT advertising "feature-barrier" and/or
"feature-flush-cache" could be done based on whether blkback
understand those commands, not on whether the underlying storage
supports the equivalent of them.

Worst case we can print a warning message once about the underlying
storage failing to complete flush/barrier requests, and that data
integrity might not be guaranteed going forward, and not propagate the
error to the upper layer?

What would be the consequence of propagating a flush error to the
upper layers?

Yes, I'm afraid it's impossible to know what the multiple incarnations
of all the scattered blkback implementations possibly do (FreeBSD,
NetBSD, QEMU and blktap at least I know of).

Given the description of the feature in the blkif header, I'm afraid
we cannot guarantee that seeing the feature exposed implies barrier or
flush support, since the request could fail at any time (or even from
the start of the disk attachment) and it would still sadly be a correct
implementation given the description of the options.

Thanks, Roger.
